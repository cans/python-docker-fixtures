- v0.1: provide basic container fixture, with basic environment
  variables overrides;
- v0.2: support mounting volumes on the container. Technically
  already doable via options, but can we do better;
- v0.3: [idea] see how we can provide tools to build
  Image instances by instrospection of images and registries;
- v0.4: [idea] How to have the fixture discover images within
  the project it is used ? (walk project tree to find Dockerfile,
  docker-compose.yml ?);
- _Add ideas here_ ;

- v1.0: 90% test coverage, pushed to pypi.
